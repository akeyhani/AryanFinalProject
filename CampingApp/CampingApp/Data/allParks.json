Insects and rodents feed on the wood, and birds and larger animals feed on them. Do not collect firewood in Great Sand Dunes National Park. Please do not bring firewood in from other regions. Help protect our public lands by buying local firewood in or near your destination campground. Firewood can spread insect pests and diseases that kill native trees. See more information on forest damage caused by firewood transport (.pdf file, 510 kb). Regionally harvested firewood is available at the Visitor Center during business hours; at Piñon Flats Campground during the busy summer season; and at the Oasis Store (privately owned, just outside the main park entrance). Collecting firewood is illegal in the national park. Pets are welcome in the campground. Please keep them leashed and under control at all times and clean up after them. Black bears are potential visitors in the campground area. Store items in boxes provided.",
